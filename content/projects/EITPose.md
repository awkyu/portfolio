Hand-pose estimation is a difficult regression problem, especially when using indirect sensing methods (non-vision based).
As part of my independent study at CMU, I've been working on a project to validate the use of indirect sensing ([EIT-kit](https://github.com/HCIELab/EIT-kit_open-source)) for hand-pose estimation. Submitted to [CHI'24](https://chi2024.acm.org/) proceedings.

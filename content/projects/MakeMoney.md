Predicting the stock market is a challenging task that has been attempted with a variety of methods. In this project, a neural network model that combines aspects of both CNNs and LSTMs to predict the appropriate position of a companyâ€™s stock (Buy, Sell, or Hold) using stock data and technical indicators commonly used by analysts. The proposed model outperformed the baseline model, but still yielded unfavorable results. You can read or download the full report for the methodology below.

Surgical resection and thermal ablation techniques have been shown to have suboptimal efficacy for the treatment of osteoid osteomas due to the high risk of complications and large ablation zones. We propose a nanosecond pulse electric field ablation system utilizing a pulse generator as a compact solution to ablate osteoid osteomas without harming the healthy bone, leading to reduced instances of post-operative complications.

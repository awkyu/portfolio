Hand-pose estimation is a difficult regression problem, especially when using indirect sensing methods (non-vision based).
As part of my independent study at CMU, I've been working on a project to validate the idea of on-the-go vision-based ([Google's Mediapipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)) calibration methods for indirect sensing ([EIT-kit](https://github.com/HCIELab/EIT-kit_open-source) and IMU) for hand-pose estimation. Planning on submitting to [CHI'24](https://chi2024.acm.org/) proceedings.

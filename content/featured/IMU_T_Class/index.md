Wearable Health Technologies course project with Dr. Eni Halilaj. The main objective of this study is to validate benefits of using the biomechanical model from [OpenSense](https://simtk.org/projects/opensense) to improve accuracy of joint kinematics estimation using IMUs during sit-to-stand. In addition, this study evaluates various sensor fusion algorithms with and without biomechanical modeling.
